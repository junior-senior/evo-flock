# evo-flock

Evoflock is a simple implementation of Evolutionary Algorithms. The program simulates a predator-prey environment with a single predator and 50 prey. The predator chases the prey and upon catching one, the prey 'dies' and a new prey is created by selecting a two existing prey from the population and then applying the processes of Crossover (combining the genotypes of the two selected prey) and Mutation. While the initial prey movement is random, over time flocking behaviour evolves in the prey as the discover how to avoid the predator.
